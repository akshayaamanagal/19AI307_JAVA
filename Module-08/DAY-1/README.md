# Ex.No:8(A)  IO-FILE STREAM
## AIM:
To implement a Java Program to write a String in a file "testout.txt" using FileInputStream

## ALGORITHM :

1. Use `try` block to handle possible file errors.

2. Create a `FileInputStream` to read from a file named `"testout.txt"`.

3. Read one byte (character) from the file using `read()`.

4. Convert the byte to a character and print it.

5. If any error occurs (like file not found), the `catch` block runs and prints the error message.

## PROGRAM:
 ```
/*
Program to implement a IO File Stream using Java
Developed by: AKSHAYAA M
RegisterNumber: 212222230009
*/
```

## Sourcecode.java:
```java
try
{
FileInputStream f=new FileInputStream("testout.txt");
int i=f.read();
System.out.print((char)i);
}
catch(Exception e){System.out.println(e);}
```

## RESULT:
Thus the implementation of a Java Program to write a String in a file "testout.txt" using FileInputStream was executed and verified successfully
