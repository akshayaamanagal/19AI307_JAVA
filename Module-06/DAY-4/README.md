# Ex.No:6(D) PACKAGES
## AIM:
  To create a Java Program for accessing package from another package using packagename.
 
## ALGORITHM :
1.	Start the Program
2.	Create a directory named pack and save A.java inside it.
2.	Compile A.java from the parent directory using javac pack/A.java.
3.	Create another directory named mypack and save B.java inside it.
4.	Compile B.java from the parent directory using javac mypack/B.java.
5.	Run B from the parent directory with java mypack.B
